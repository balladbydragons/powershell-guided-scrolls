Each folder holds a specific domain of commandâ€”targeted spells (scripts) to empower your craft.

### How to Read These Scrolls

These Guided Scrolls are **not** meant to be executed start to finish like a script. They are **living reference tomes**â€”collections of annotated commands for IT tasks.

Use them by:

* Browsing the scroll by section (or using CTRL+F) to locate what you need.
* Copying individual commands into PowerShell as your task requires.
* Adapting syntax or variables for your environment.

To enable PowerShell scripting, if needed:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Requirements

- PowerShell (v5.0 or later recommended).
- Administrative permissions to execute advanced scripts
